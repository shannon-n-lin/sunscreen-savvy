## Project Problem Statement
It can be really challenging for some people looking to buy sunscreens to find trustworthy product reviews or reviews that address their specific needs/concerns. People often end up buying products that don't work for them, e.g. sunscreens that break them out, irritate their skin, or make them look like a chalky ghost.

With this web app, consumers can gain more insight on which sunscreens will work for their specific needs, reducing the amount of time and money spent trying to find products and reducing with their environmental impact.
